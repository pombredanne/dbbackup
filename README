This is a simple script that can be used to back up Postgres, MySQL, and
the system RPM databases running on the system.  It writes the backups
out to a directory and deletes files older than a certain number of days.
It's operation can be modified by editing "/etc/dbbackup.conf".  Backups,
by default, are written to "/var/lib/dbbackup".

MySQL backups by default are disabled (because you probably need a password
to do them).  To enable, edit "/etc/dbbackup.conf".  PostgreSQL and RPM
database backups are enabled by default.

It also makes a hardlink for the latest backup into a non-date based
version, to make it easier on backup systems.  This must be enabled in the
config file.  The backup system should also be configured to ignore the
date-based files or duplicates of the data will be stored.
